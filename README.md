# mortgage-payment-calculator
Program is used to calculate the total number of months/years needed after entering the principal, interest, and monthly payments you would like. 

This is one of my first programs and my first program in C++. It requires you to enter a principal amount, interest rate (whole numbers only b/c I used an int variable), and what monthly payment you would be paying. It's a basic program but I was just tyring to learn the fundamentals.
